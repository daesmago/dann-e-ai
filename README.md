## Setup
1. Initialize the project's backend in VS Code or an IDE like WebStorm, making sure you are inside the folder "server", using the next script:
```
$ npm start
```
2. This will connect the application to the MongoDB database and make the application server available in the port: "8080".
3. Initialize the project's frontend in VS Code or an IDE like WebStorm, making sure you are inside the folder "client", using the next script:
```
$ npm run dev
```
4. This will deploy the application frontend in the url: "http://localhost:5173"
